			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img id="me" alt="pic of me" src="./assets/images/me.jpg"/>
			<p>I grew up in a small Colorado town. After college I moved to San Francisco for a few years to accomplish a dream and realized I am a straight up Colorado girl and the mountains are a source of passion for me. I'm an outgoing, genuine girl who loves to have a good time! I'm just as goofy as I am grounded. I can adapt to any environment no matter how fancy, how professional, how casual or how random it may be. You can take me anywhere! I love making new connections with people everywhere I go and have friends from all walks of life and consider that one of my greatest assets.</p>
			<p> I like to mix it up:one night hang at the local dive bar;the next go swanky!I love trying new restaurants but two of my local favorites:Cafe Brazil and Vendome.I am enamored with French culture and love to tell stories of my adventures in S. America.</p>
			<p>Just a few of my favorite things...skiing/boarding, camping, working out, Chianti, snowshoeing, the Simpsons, Autumn days in Colorado, staying in watching football on a cloudy day, charity work, and deep conversation with a good friend.</p>
			<p>It’s all about adventure and fun.I love traveling to new places and pushing myself above perceived limits.Good food, wine,and company are life’s musts.When I’m not skiing or enjoying the sun, I’m resting with a movie, book, or throwing dinner parties</p>
